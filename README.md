# The Data Nurse

Welcome to The Data Nurse!

Hi there! I’m a nurse with a love for data, here to share my journey from bedside care to data science. 
After countless hours at the bedside, I found myself wanting to explore further. My curiosity and drive to understand the “why” behind every process revealed a new path—one that combined my love for healthcare with my desire for deeper insights and solutions.

In bedside nursing, I often felt constrained by “hospital policy” or “doctor’s orders,” even when I saw opportunities for better outcomes. I realized that having a real voice in healthcare meant going beyond direct patient care—it meant shaping policies and driving change through data and research. Politics isn’t my path, but working with data is

When I'm not diving into data or healthcare, you'll probably find me reading Spy×Family for the nth time, digging into theology, or writing (hopefully not terrible) poems. 

This space is a documentation of my journey and a place where I share insights, projects, and lessons learned along the way.

Thanks for stopping by!
